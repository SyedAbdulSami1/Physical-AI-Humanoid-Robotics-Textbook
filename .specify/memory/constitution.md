# Physical-AI-Humanoid-Robotics-Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Core Functionality: RAG Chatbot
The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot is the central feature. It must provide accurate answers based exclusively on the content of the book.

### II. User-Centric Bonus Features
All bonus features, including personalization, Urdu translation, and authentication, must be fully functional and designed with a user-friendly experience as a priority.

### III. Design: Mobile-Responsive
The entire application, including the chatbot, must feature a mobile-responsive design to ensure usability across all device types.

### IV. Methodology: Spec-Kit Plus
The project will strictly adhere to the Spec-Kit Plus development methodology, ensuring proper creation and maintenance of Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) and Prompt History Records (PHRs).

### V. AI-Assisted Development
This project will be developed with the assistance of an AI agent. The AI will be guided by the project's constitution and will be responsible for tasks such as code generation, documentation, and testing.

### VI. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
For any complex or ambiguous tasks, the AI agent will require human confirmation before proceeding. The agent will present its plan and await explicit approval.

## Constraints & Technology Stack

The project must be built within the following technical constraints:
- **Frontend:** Built using the latest version of Docusaurus.
- **Deployment:** Deployed on either GitHub Pages or Vercel.
- **Backend:** The RAG backend will be built with FastAPI.
- **Data & Search:** Utilizes Qdrant Cloud (free tier) for vector search and Neon Serverless Postgres (free tier) for data storage.
- **Budget:** All services must use free tiers wherever possible.

## Governance
This Constitution supersedes all other practices. All development work, pull requests, and reviews must verify compliance with these principles and constraints. Amendments require documentation, team approval, and a clear migration plan.
