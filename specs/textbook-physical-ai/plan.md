# Plan: AI-Native Textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This document outlines the architectural and implementation plan for creating a comprehensive, AI-native textbook on "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics." This project is undertaken as part of the Panaversity Hackathon I and strictly follows the Spec-Kit Plus methodology.

## 1. Architecture Overview

The system is designed with a clear separation of concerns, ensuring modularity and scalability. It separates content authoring, frontend presentation, and backend intelligence into distinct, interoperable layers.

*High-Level Component Diagram Description:*

The architecture is composed of five primary, decoupled components:

1.  **Book Content (`/docs`)**: The single source of truth for all educational material, written in standards-compliant Markdown. This allows for content to be managed, versioned, and updated independently of the presentation or backend logic.
2.  **Docusaurus Site (Frontend)**: A static site generated by Docusaurus, responsible for rendering the book content. It will be themed with TailwindCSS and will host custom React components for all interactive features, including the RAG chatbot UI.
3.  **Backend Services (FastAPI)**: A robust backend built with Python and FastAPI, serving as the application's intelligent core. It will expose RESTful APIs for all dynamic features, including the RAG pipeline.
4.  **RAG Chatbot (AI Core)**: An integrated service that powers the conversational AI.
    *   **Orchestration**: Manages the retrieval-generation process, including "selected text only" mode.
    *   **Vector DB**: **Qdrant Cloud (Free Tier)** stores and indexes embeddings of the book content for efficient semantic search.
    *   **LLM**: **Google Gemini** models will generate context-aware answers.
    *   **UI**: A component embedded within the Docusaurus site provides the user interface.

## 4. Dependency Graph

This graph illustrates the development sequence and dependencies between major phases.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Phase 1: Constitution & Setup] --> B[Phase 2: Core Book Writing];
    B --> C[Phase 3: RAG Backend];
    C --> D[Phase 4: Frontend Integration];
    D --> E[Phase 5: Polish & Deploy];
```
- **Core Book Writing (B)** can start after setup, and its content is a dependency for the **RAG Backend (C)**.
- The **RAG Backend (C)** can be developed in parallel with content, but ingestion requires content.
- **Frontend Integration (D)** depends on a functional backend.

## 5. Research & Reusable Intelligence Strategy

We will research advanced topics to ensure cutting-edge content and create reusable AI "Skills" or "Subagents" to accelerate development and aim for bonus points.

**Research Topics:**
- **Robotics Simulators:** Best practices for `ROS 2` (Jazzy) and `Isaac Sim` for creating reproducible examples.
- **VLA Models:** Investigate state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action models for chapters on advanced robot interaction.
- **Embedding & Chunking:** Analyze different strategies for Markdown chunking (semantic vs. fixed-size) to optimize RAG retrieval accuracy.

**Reusable Intelligence (Skills/Subagents) Candidates:**
- **`Skill:MarkdownChapterGenerator`:** A subagent to draft chapters from an outline, ensuring consistent structure and tone.
- **`Skill:RoboticsCodeGenerator`:** A subagent to generate Python code examples for `ROS 2` and `Isaac Sim`.
- **`Skill:QdrantIndexer`:** A reusable skill for chunking, embedding, and indexing Markdown content into Qdrant.
- **`Subagent:ADRGenerator`:** An agent to automate the creation of draft ADR files from a given decision context.
- **`Subagent:SpecScanner`:** A subagent that reads the `spec.md` and generates a test plan or checklist.

## 6. Design Decisions That Require ADRs

The following architectural decisions are significant and require formal ADRs to document their rationale and tradeoffs.

1.  **Frontend Framework Choice:** Docusaurus vs. Next.js with MDX.
2.  **Vector Database Host:** Local Qdrant vs. Qdrant Cloud.
3.  **RAG Content Chunking Strategy:** Fixed-size vs. recursive vs. semantic chunking of Markdown.
4.  **Text Embedding Model:** Google Gemini `embedding-001` vs. a newer/open-source alternative.
5.  **Deployment Platform:** GitHub Pages (for static content) vs. Vercel (for integrated backend/frontend).
6.  **Frontend Styling:** TailwindCSS vs. Emotion vs. plain CSS Modules.
7.  **Chat UI Library:** Using a pre-built library like ChatKit vs. building a custom React component.
8.  **"Selected Text Only" RAG Logic:** Prompt engineering vs. a separate, filtered retrieval mechanism in the backend.

## 7. Testing & Validation Strategy

A multi-layered testing strategy will be employed to ensure quality across all components.

| Area                      | Validation Method                                                                                                   |
|:--------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Book Completeness**     | Peer review of each chapter against the `spec.md`. Automated checks for broken links, images, and formatting errors. |
| **RAG Accuracy**          | A "golden dataset" of 50+ question-answer pairs will be created. An automated script will run these questions and validate that the chatbot's answers are semantically correct and derived only from the book. |
| **"Selected Text Only"**  | Unit and integration tests will confirm that when text is selected, the RAG context is strictly limited to that selection. |

| **Mobile Responsiveness** | Manual testing on Chrome DevTools and real devices. Automated visual regression testing with a tool like Percy (optional). |
| **GitHub Pages Deployment**| A full CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions will build and deploy the site. Smoke tests will run against the live URL after each deployment. |

## 8. Success Criteria per Phase

Each phase concludes with measurable outcomes to verify completion.

| Phase                      | Measurable Exit Criteria                                                                                               |
|:---------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Constitution & Setup**  | `constitution.md` is ratified. The Docusaurus site runs locally (`npm run start`). The `spec.md` is finalized.            |
| **2. Core Book Writing**     | At least 10 of the 13+ chapters are written, reviewed, and merged into the `main` branch.                              |
| **3. RAG Backend**           | The `/rag` API endpoint successfully returns a structured answer from a test query. The Qdrant collection contains over 1,000 vectors from the book content. |
| **4. Frontend Integration**  | The chatbot UI is functional on the website. A user can receive answers from both full-book and "selected text" queries. |
| **5. Polish & Deploy**       | All critical bugs are resolved. The site is live at its public URL and achieves a Lighthouse performance score over 90. |
